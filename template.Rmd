I'm an R Markdown document! 

```{r, include= FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```


# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

```{r}
ladfg <- tibble(sample_2 = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
logic_var = sample_2 > 0,
abs_var = abs(sample_2))

ladfg %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = abs_var))
```
